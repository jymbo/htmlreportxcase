HTML Reporting Export for the XCASE Modeling Tool
Project Description

     The project is composed of a series of scripts that allows users of the ©XCASE (http://www.xcase.com/) database modeling tool to export model meta data to HTML documents. These HTML documents are incorporated in a website that can be used as a means for modeling team members and end users to view ©XCASE model meta data without having to be in the ©XCASE tool. 

     The website contains 3 frames, a top frame, a title frame and a tree view for the model objects. The tree view allows you to click on folder nodes for the model tables, views, procedures, functions, etc. and view their meta data. There is also a directory that you can dump your exported model images to and have them show up automatically in nodes under the diagrams folder node after running the scripts.
